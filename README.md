# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Lou-Anne
I am currently in the process of transitioning my career towards web development and programming, driven by a strong passion for technology and problem-solving. I have recently completed my first training in web development with OpenClassrooms, where I gained foundational skills in front-end and back-end development. To further deepen my knowledge and enhance my coding expertise, I will soon be enrolling in the renowned 42 School. I am excited about the opportunities and challenges this new path presents and look forward to building innovative digital solutions.
